# Covid-19_Live_Project 
Project Requirements:

1-Python
2-Pandas (for data manipulation)
3-Matplotlib & Seaborn(for data visualization)
[COVID-19 dataset (You can use publicly available datasets from sources like government health websites).]

Steps:

1-Data Retrieval:
  (I)-Obtain COVID-19 data from a reliable source, such as a government health department or a trusted dataset repository.

2-Data Preprocessing:
  (I)-the COVID-19 data into a Pandas DataFrame.

3-Identify Top 7 States with the Highest Active Cases:
  (I)-Calculate the active cases for each state by subtracting cured cases and deaths from total cases.
  (II)-Sort the data by active cases in descending order.
  (III)-Select the top 7 states with the highest active cases.

4-Discover Top 7 States with the Most Cured Cases:
  (I)-Sort the data by the number of cured cases in descending order.
  (II)-Select the top 7 states with the most cured cases.

5-Highlight Top 7 States with the Maximum Reported Deaths:
  (I)-Sort the data by the number of deaths in descending order.
  (II)-Select the top 7 states with the maximum reported deaths.

6-Data Visualization (Optional):
  (I)-Create visualizations, such as bar charts or pie charts, to represent the findings for each of the above steps.

7-Display Results:
  (I)-Print or display the results of the analysis, including the top 7 states for each category, on the screen or in a graphical user interface (GUI).

8-Update Data Regularly (For a Live Project):
  (I)-If you want to make this a live project, you can set up a scheduled task or use a data source that provides real-time or daily updates on COVID-19 cases.

By following these steps, i am create a live COVID-19 data analysis project that identifies the top 7 states with the highest active cases, discovers the top 7 states with the most cured cases, and highlights the top 7 states with the maximum reported deaths using Python and its libraries. This project can serve as a valuable tool for tracking and understanding the COVID-19 situation in different regions.
